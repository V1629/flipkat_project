Project Overview
The Smart Quality Test System is an automated solution for product quality testing using real-time camera feed and image processing. The system analyzes product images from multiple angles and detects surface-level defects such as cracks, deformations, and discolorations using deep learning models. This solution enhances quality control processes by minimizing manual inspections and ensuring consistent defect detection.

Key Features
Real-Time Camera Vision: Captures video streams for on-the-fly defect analysis.
Advanced Image Processing: Detects visual anomalies using edge detection, contour analysis, and segmentation.
Machine Learning Models: Trains models on product image data to classify defects.
Automated Reporting: Generates quality assessment reports with defect details.
Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python


Libraries:
OpenCV (Image processing and camera integration)
TensorFlow/Keras (Machine learning models)
NumPy, Pandas (Data manipulation and analysis)
Matplotlib, Seaborn (Visualization)
Other Tools: Git, Jupyter Notebooks
